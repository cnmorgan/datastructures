## TODO

in the  directory execute the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main
```

You should see the output of the sample code. This means that everthing was set up correctly.

You should look through the example files given to get an idea of the organization of the project. You should also make sure to look at the CMakeLists.txt to see what you will need
to change as your project grows and new files and/or modules are added.

After you have made sure you understand the structure of this project, remove all of the sample code and you can begin adding to your project.
